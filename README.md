This simulator is built on top of Panda3D 1.8.1 

Panda3D is available from panda3d.org

Once Panda3D is installed, navigate to the root directory of this project 
and run:

	ppython main.py
	
(Note: ppython is not a typo - Panda3D installs its own version of python)

This will open up a window displaying the simulation in action.

Demonstrations of specific funtionality are availabe in the test_xxx.py files.
